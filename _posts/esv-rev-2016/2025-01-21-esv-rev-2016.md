In my last post I explored the revisions between the 2007 and 2011 ESV Text.[^fn1] Now I'm moving on to the third revision to the 2016 text edition. The list of changes are relatively short this time (52) and so is this post. Crossway still has the changes posted on their website.[^fn2] Unfortunately, the HTML table they use is formatted in an annoying way so that instead of

| **Reference** | **Old Text** | **New Text** |

it is

| Reference |
| --------- | -------- |
| Old Text  | New Text |

I decided to copy the HTML table into a tab seperated file (`*.tsv`) and then write a Python script to transpose the rows into the right format. I've been writing a lot of text formatting scripts in Python lately and I don't know if that's a good thing. In this case, it turns out to be fairly straightforward. I can use the `csv` library to iterate through the file. If the row has one column it's the reference and if it has two columns it's the old and new texts.

This is bit of an aside but I wish there was a rich text format for comma seperated tables. I wantted to maintain the bold text in the original HTML (indicating which words were changed) but all that was lost when I copied it to the `*.tsv` file. I suppose that's why I keep using Markdown tables to save these changes as it is plaintext but can also have formatting applied. And as I discovered in my last post it's easy to pull the data (as long as it's not formatted) into Pandas. Anyways, my script ended up looking like this:

```python
import csv

# tab-delimited table
filename = '.tables/.esv-2016-changes.tsv'

md_table = '|Bible Reference|2011 Text|2016 Text|\n|---|---|---|\n'

# open the file in read mode
with open(filename, 'r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as tsvfile:
  # Create a csv reader object, specifying the tab delimiter
  tsv_reader = csv.reader(tsvfile, delimiter='\t')

  # combine every other row
  for row in tsv_reader:
    if len(row) == 1:
      ref = row[0]
    elif len(row) == 2:
      md_table += f'|{ref}|{row[1]}|{row[0]}|\n'

# save Markdown file
with open('.tables/.esv-2016-changes.md', 'w') as f:
    print(md_table, file=f)
```

Now that I have the table formatted the way I wanted I need to highlight the changed words for readability. I used the same approach as my last post with the `difflib` and using my own functions for each opcode tag. I won't repeat the code but you can find it on my last post.[^fn1] And there you have it, nice and easy. The 2025 revisions are going to take a little longer as they're in a PDF format and also include footnote changes.
