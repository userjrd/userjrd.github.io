The last few years I have begun to try and escape from subscription models. Spotify was the first subscription I ever paid for. For the price of half a CD a month I could access pretty much every song ever produced. You can trace the growth of subscription-based business models through the likes of Netflix in 1999 (back when they send DVDs through the mail), Spotify in 2006, Dropbox around 2008, Adobe switching to software as a service (SaaS) in 2012, and Microsoft's GamePass in 2017. I'm sure the list is much longer but these were the ones that stood out.

## Subscribing Isn't Buying
The ugly side of subscriptions comes down to owning nothing. Subscriptions sell access not ownership. And despite the years of investment that I may give a company, that access can be revoked at any time. The terms of service for Audible even say this explicitly.

> When you purchase content from Audible, you are purchasing a license that is subject to the rights and restrictions provided by Audible’s License. Once we have made purchased content available to you for download, we encourage you to download the content promptly after purchase. As a convenience to you we may continue to make your purchased content available for re-download through your Service account, but we do not guarantee that such content will be available for re-download and Audible will not be liable to you if it becomes unavailable for further re-download.

In the last 20 years we've seen our software and files shift from being on our computer or a flash drive to being in "the cloud". Even some software such as SketchUp can no longer be downloaded to your computer and has to be run from the web. Centralized technology may be convenient but it comes with a loss of control.

Recently, an agreement between Warner Bros Discovery and Sony Playstation ended that *nearly* left customers who had purchased access to Discovery content through the Playstation store unable to view the content[^fn1]. After public outrage they reversed their decision to save face. But it revealed a very present reality: purchases within these platforms are still only the purchase of access and not ownership. 

If you look around, digital rights management (DRM) is all around us. Movies bought from Apple can be downloaded to your computer (in lower quality) but only played through iTunes. Audiobooks bought on Audible can be downloaded from their website but can only be listened to on authorized devices. eBooks bought on Kindle can only be downloaded to specific devices or software. Video games bought on Steam can only be played with the Steam client installed.

## Copyright Goes Beyond Piracy
DRM controls largely flow out of the 1998 Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) which ammended Title 17 of the [US Copyright Code](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title17&edition=prelim). With the rise of digital media at the turn of the century the question arose of *how do you protect copyright owners' control over their digital media?* I had always assumed DMCA was primarily concerned with just stopping piracy. Unfortunately this is not the case and digital copyright reaches much furthur into controlling how you are allowed to *access* media.

In 2017, the United States Copyright Office published a report on Section 1201 of Title 17 Copyright Code roughly 20 years after DMCA was implemented. Reading the report was very enlightening and sobering to understand the motivation behind the digital copyright provisions. I've included the following excerpt from the report. Yes, it's dense, but it is extremely informative as to how Congress views digital copyright law.

> In the words of the Department of Justice in opposing a nexus requirement on behalf of the United States, “[t]he entire point of that provision was to provide a federal prohibition against bypassing passwords, encryption, and other technologies that regulate access to a copyrighted work in circumstances in which the act of obtaining access would not by itself violate the copyright laws.”

What is being said here? Congress deliberately decided that it is illegal to bypass any DRM regardless of whether or not the goal is to pirate or illegally share the media. That means if you want a "hard copy" of your audiobooks you bought from Audible, it is illegal to remove the encryption on the file, regardless that you legally paid for them. 

## The Intentional Loss of Ownership
Further into the report, the Copyright Office says the following:

> Congress recognized that the growth of the digital marketplace depends on copyright owners having the ability to enforce the terms they establish for online access to their works. In particular, Congress sought to facilitate the development of online content delivery platforms in which the consumer pays for *access* to copyrighted material rather than for possession of a copy.

It seems clear that Congress wants to create a world in which you don't own digital media. A world in which a select few have copyrights and for a price allow consumers access. Subscription models are by their very nature a means to silo content. Digital media may not be behind closed doors but they are now often behind paywalls.

## A Brief Look at Historical Precedents
No, I don't think we should get rid of copyright law. A world of free-media is unsustainable for the people creating the media. But neither do I think that we got it right on the first try with DMCA. Let's take a look at the not-too-distant past to see if there are any precedents for copyright laws that work.

### Cable TV
We didn't have TV growing up but I had friends that did. It was a common occurance for them to record a show they didn't have time to see and watch it later. Lawmakers call this "time stretching". In 1984 in Sony Corp of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc, the Supreme court ruled that time shifting, recording a show to watch later, did not violate copyright and was covered under fair use. The Supreme Court distinguished between 

What if we drew a parallel from cable to streaming. Say I wanted to do something similar and record a show to watch it later. Would this be covered under timestretching? No. Under DMCA this is considered bypassing DRM and making an illegal copy.

### CDs
